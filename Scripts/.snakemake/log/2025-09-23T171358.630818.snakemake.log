MissingOutputException in rule footprints_final in file "/Users/reedkenny/Desktop/Urban_tree_fire/structure_analysis/Scripts/pipeline_Snakefile", line 47:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/reedkenny/Desktop/Urban_tree_fire/structure_analysis/tmp_data/eaton_burned_fprints.shp (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
